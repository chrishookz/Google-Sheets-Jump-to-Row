//This Google Apps Script allow you to add several entries to a dropdown list that exactly match a row below the dropdown.
//When a value is selected from the dropdown the onEdit script will trigger, use a text finder to locate the row of the matching text.
//The script then sets the active row as the last row on the sheet before setting the active row of the located value.
//This is done to ensure that the located row shows up at the top of the screen instead of the bottom.
